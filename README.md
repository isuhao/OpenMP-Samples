# OpenMP-Samples

## About
Some OpenMP Samples

## Development
* **Programming Language**: C++11
* **OpenMP**: C++11
* **Compiler**: Intel C++ Compiler (ICC) 17.0
* **IDE**: Visual Studio 2015

Note: Since MSVC++ supports only OpenMP 2.0 and Clang for Visual Studio does not support OpenMP out-of-the-box, we use ICC to be able to use newer OpenMP features. However, some code samples can be built with MSVC++ or Clang.
